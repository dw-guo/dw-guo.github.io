##### Abstract

This study examines how monetary incentives and prosocial factors jointly influence household participation in Direct Load Control (DLC) programs. Building on a theoretical framework of crowding-out effects, we explore how extrinsic monetary incentives may undermine intrinsic motivations rooted in public spirit and social norms. To test these dynamics, we conducted a two-part survey in Beijing and Shanghai, China. The first part employs a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit householdsâ€™ preferences over DLC attributes, providing a basis for pricing strategies in the Chinese residential market. The second part is a randomized experiment that manipulates compensation levels and regulatory messages to identify crowding-out effects. Our findings reveal that intrinsic motivations significantly drive DLC participation, while small monetary incentives can erode these motivations and reduce participation rates. However, sufficiently large financial incentives can reverse this effect by dominating the decision calculus. These results underscore the importance of carefully balancing intrinsic and extrinsic incentives in the design of demand side management (DSM) programs.
