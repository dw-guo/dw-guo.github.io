##### Abstract

This paper examines how large-scale poverty alleviation resettlement influences household labor allocation and income generation in rural China. We study the Poverty Alleviation Resettlement Program (PARP), which relocates impoverished households from remote mountainous villages to newly built communities closer to urban centers. We propose a theoretical framework where resettlement affects households through two competing mechanisms: a last-mile channel that reduces migration costs and promotes temporary urban work, and a home-attachment channel that improves living amenities, raising both the utility and the costs of staying home. Using a rich panel of all officially registered poor households in the treatment county from 2014 to 2022, we implement the difference-in-differences design to identify program effects. We find that PARP substantially increases total income and migrant wages, driven by shifts of labor from farming to urban employment. However, these gains are highly uneven: households with abundant labor supply experience large increases in migrant work, while labor-constrained households see stagnant or even declining earnings, as higher living costs crowd out their ability to finance migration. These results reveal that resettlement can unintentionally widen inequality among the poor, highlighting the importance of household labor endowments in shaping the welfare impacts of anti-poverty programs.
